SignWaver is a background application that leverages hand gestures and voice commands to control the Windows OS. Users can control various aspects of their system through intuitive gestures. The application recognizes dynamic hand gestures to select actions such as opening specific applications using voice commands. Additionally, users can adjust system settings like volume and brightness through hand gestures. For example moving the gesture of the hand shape V upward increases the systems volume! It also enables keyboard and mouse free web browsing by supporting gestures for opening opening, closing  and navigating between tabs. The application also supports scrolling, audio muting, and text entry all through voice commands and hand gestures. Furthermore, it includes a **sophisticated deep learning image processing feature**, allowing users to take "snapshots" of their current screen and generate descriptive text from the images, allowing for further interaction based on the content scanned.
